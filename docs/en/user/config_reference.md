# Configuration Reference

The Vega is highly modularized. The search space, search algorithm, and pipeline can be built through configuration. To run the Vega application is to load the configuration file and complete the AutoML process according to the configuration, as shown in the following figure.

```python
import vega


if __name__ == "__main__":
    vega.run("./main.yml")
```

The following describes the configuration items in the main.yml file in detail.

## 1. Overall structure

The configuration of the vega can be divided into two parts:

1. The general configuration item is used to set common and common configuration items, such as the output path and log level.
2. Pipeline configuration, including the following two parts:
   1. Pipeline definition. The configuration item name is pipeline, which is a list that contains all steps in the pipeline.
   2. Defines each step in Pipeline. The configuration item name is the name of each step defined in Pipeline.

```yaml
general:
    # general configuration

# Defining a Pipeline.
pipeline: [my_nas, my_hpo, my_data_augmentation, my_fully_train]

# defines each step. Refer to the following sections for details about
my_nas:
    # NAS configuration

my_hpo:
    # HPO configuration

my_data_augmentation:
    # Data augmentation configuration

my_fully_train:
    # fully train configuration
```

The following describes each configuration item in detail.

## 2. Public configuration items

The following public configuration items can be configured:

| Configuration Item | Description |
| :--: | :-- |
| local_base_path | Working path. Each time when the system is running, a subfolder with time information (task id) is generated in the path. In this way, the output of multiple running is not overwritten. The task id subfolder contains two subfolders: output and worker. The output folder stores the output data of each step in the pipeline, and the worker folder stores temporary information.  <br> **In the clustered scenario, this path needs to be set to an EFS path that can be accessed by each computing node, and is used by different nodes to share data.**||
| backup_base_path | Backup path. This parameter is used in the cloud channel environment or cluster environment. The output and task files in the local path are backed up to this path. |
| timeout | Worker timeout interval, in hours. If the task is not completed within the interval, the worker is forcibly terminated. The unit is hour. The default value is 10. |
| devices_per_job | Number of GPUs used by each worker in the search phase, -1 means that one worker uses all GPUs of the node, 1 means one worker uses one GPU, 2 means one worker uses two GPUs, and so on. |
| logger.level | Log level, which can be set to debug \| info \| warn \| error \| critical. default level is info. |
| cluster.master_ip | In the cluster scenario, this parameter needs to be set to the IP address of the master node. |
| cluster.listen_port | In the cluster scenario, you need to pay attention to this parameter. If port 8000 is occupied, you need to adjust the monitoring port. |
| cluster.slaves | In the cluster scenario, this parameter needs to be set to the IP address of other nodes except the master node. |

```yaml
general:
    task:
        local_base_path: "./tasks"
        backup_base_path: ~
    worker:

## 7. Trainer configuration item

In each of the preceding pipeline steps, the configuration item trainer is provided. You can configure the basic trainer and extended trainer. The basic configuration information of the trainer is as follows:

| model_desc | Model description, which is mutually exclusive with model_desc_file. model_desc_file takes precedence over model_desc_file. And the parameter shuffle of the dataset must be set to False. |
| model_desc_file | File where the model description information is located. This parameter is mutually exclusive with model_desc, and model_desc_file takes priority over model_desc_file. |
| hps_file | Hyper-parameter file |
